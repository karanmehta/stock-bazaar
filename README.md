# Stock Bazaar

Stock Bazaar is stock ticker app. Below are the technologies used in this app:

  - ReactJS
  - Websocket
  - Graphs (to do)

  You can view the live demo of Stock Bazaar [here](https://karanmehta.github.io/stock-bazaar-app/).
  NOTE: Browser will throwing "Mixed content" error, and javascript files won't be executed untill you click on "load unsafe scripts". I am looking for workaround for it.

### What I learned

* Hash Table - Hash Table is the quickest way to access and update the data
* Graph Chart - Read about react-sparkline (implementation in progress)

### Installation
Stock Bazaar requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v9+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd stock-bazaar
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm run prod
```

### Todos

 - Build utility components (table)
 - Add Graphs
 - Enhance UI
 - Add Dark Mode
